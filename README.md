# LiveStatsDatabasePlugin

Plugin developed for use in HSSP summer 2020 class: **Game Design and Development with Minecraft in Java**

If you want to test the challenges on your own, *this plugin is not necessary*. This plugin will log all server logs onto a MongoDB database so that the frontend website can display those logs to the students.

Additionally, it will prevent the players from moving if the challenge is not active. This is dependent on the backend webserver being online, and will default to an inactive challenge if the backend webserver is offline.

For more details on how to use this plugin and potentially teach this class, see https://minecraftgamedev.github.io/teach/.
